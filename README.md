# Machine-learning-CSE2510
CSE2510 final assignment

In this assignment, me and my teammate will explored the MNIST & American Census datasets. Each dataset has
its own shortcomings and problems that we had to overcome to find the best possible classifier. During this assignment,we explored the effectiveness of the following algorithms on these datasets:
• Gaussian Naive Bayes;
• K Nearest Neighbors;
• Logistic Regression;
• Support Vector Machine;
• Decision Trees;
